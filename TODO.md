A very basic TODO file, which most likely doesn't capture everything. 

A first task for someone wanting to understand Git/Github is to update this TODO file with the notes of the Permolat meeting held on 03 June 2025 where the concept for this mapping system was extensively discussed.

1. Get alpha test of the system online and available to users
2. Enable a small, trusted group of users to start editing track information and test the system, reporting faults and errors
3. WILL NEED A TESTING/STAGING SITE ESTABLISHED - TAKE ADVICE
4. Build, train, and mentor (as necessary) a core group of maintainers/committers
5. Improve database schema, thinking of all possible future uses. I encourage a big focus on this, to avoid issues many years down the track.    
6. Focus on usability of frontend platform
7. Think of offline app development, data-sharing and re-use for other navigation apps.
